This piece is entirely based on the Fibonacci Sequence and the resulting ‘golden ratio’, which are incorporated into all aspects of the design including the layout, ellipse elements, rectangle/arc sizes and positions, and how they all relate to one another. Almost every design element takes its parameters directly from a fibonacci number, each time being called by an essential custom recursive method.
